# Code of Conduct

Welcome to `spyoncino`. I’m Andrea, the maintainer. These expectations keep collaboration practical and respectful.

## What We Expect

- Welcome questions, ideas, and contributions of any size.
- Keep feedback focused on the work, the goal is always improving the project.
- Share helpful context—logs, screenshots, or reasoning—so others can jump in faster.
- Respect personal boundaries: no harassment, discrimination, or unwanted contact anywhere the project lives.

## If Something Goes Wrong

Let me know if something violates this code:

1. [Contact me](https://github.com/AndreaMichielon) privately through my GitHub profile link.
2. Share whatever details help me understand (what happened, where, links, timestamps).
3. I’ll reply within a few days with next steps.

I’ll keep reports confidential and only loop someone else in if I absolutely need help resolving it.

## Enforcement

When necessary, I may issue warnings, limit participation, or remove content.

Thanks for helping to keep `spyoncino` a supportive place to collaborate.
