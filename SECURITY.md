# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep `spyoncino` safe. We follow a responsible disclosure process so that issues can be fixed before they become public.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Submit a private report through GitHub’s security advisory form: <https://github.com/AndreaMichielon/spyoncino/security/advisories/new>.
2. If that isn’t possible, email the maintainer using the public contact address listed on the [GitHub profile](https://github.com/AndreaMichielon) (or replace this line with a dedicated security inbox you monitor).
3. Include a clear description, reproduction steps, potential impact, and any suggested fixes.

Please avoid filing public issues or sharing exploit details until a fix is released.

## What to Expect

- Acknowledgement within **3 business days**.
- Status updates at least once every **7 days** while we work on a fix.
- Coordinated disclosure so we can release a patch before going public. High-severity issues are prioritised; if remediation takes longer than 30 days, we will keep you informed.

We’re happy to credit researchers in release notes unless you request otherwise.
